# **Message Encryption and Decryption**

## **Project Description**  
The **Message Encryption and Decryption** project is an interface where users can securely encrypt and decrypt messages.  
Users can:  
- Enter their **Name**, **Message**, **Key**, and **Mode** (Encrypt or Decrypt).  
- View the **Result** based on the selected mode.  
- Use the following options:  
  - **Show Message**: Displays the encrypted or decrypted message.  
  - **Reset**: Clears all input fields for new data.  
  - **Exit**: Closes the application.  

This project is powered by custom encryption and decryption algorithms.
